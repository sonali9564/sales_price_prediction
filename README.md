# Objective
To understand, analyze, and represent the dataset to predict sales prices using machine learning techniques.
# Steps
1. Loading the Dataset - Download the dataset from Kaggle using the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data/data

3. Basic Understanding of the Data -
It's crucial to understand the basic information regarding the dataset to ensure proper training of the model.
This involves examining the features, the target variable, and the data types.

4. Data Cleaning -
This step involves filling in missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and ensuring consistency across all attributes.
Proper data cleaning is essential for the accuracy of the model.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -
Perform statistical analysis on the data and visualize it to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
This helps in identifying key features that influence car prices.  

6. Training the Model -
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
The model is then trained using appropriate machine learning algorithms to learn the patterns in the data.  

7. Testing the Model -
The trained model is tested on the 20% testing dataset.
This helps in evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.  

8. Evaluating the Model -
Finally, the R² score of the model is checked on both training and testing data.
The training data R² score is 85.5% and the testing data R² score is 85.5%.  

# Outcome
The model successfully predicts car prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy, as indicated by the R² scores.
